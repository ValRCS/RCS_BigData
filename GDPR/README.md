## What Data is covered by GDPR?

**Personal data’** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’).

“[A]n identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”

Janis Berzins by itself is not personal data, it needs additional information(such as address or phone) to become personal data.

Depending on **context** some of the following could become **personal data**

* Biographical information or current living situation, including dates of birth, Social Security numbers, phone numbers and email addresses.
* Looks, appearance and behaviour, including eye colour, weight and character traits.
* Workplace data and information about education, including salary, tax information and student numbers.
* Private and subjective data, including religion, political opinions and geo-tracking data.
* Health, sickness and genetics, including medical history, genetic data and information about sick leave.

## Not covered:
Properly pseudo-anonymized personal data, data about everything else(weather, insects, dogs, cats, etc, etc, as long as it can not be used to rebuild into personal data).

## Modelling Explanation

According to the GDPR owner’s rights, the data subject (the user/customer) has the **right to explanation**. For machine learning, this refers to the fact that the data processor must provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
