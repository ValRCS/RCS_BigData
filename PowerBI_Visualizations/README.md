Popular with Excel and SQl crowd at Microsoft


#### “Data pictures” fall into two main categories:

Infographics – An artistic ice cream sundae with data sprinkled on top
Data Visualizations – A data ice cream sundae with artistic sprinkles on top.

Infographics are more of an artistic expression with data skillfully woven throughout.

Data visualizations are more of a data foundation with a pre-fab artistic element layered on top.

# Power BI is used to make Data Visualizations, not Infographics.
