    "Data science projects offer you a promising way to kick-start your career in this field. Not only do you get to learn data science by applying it, you also get projects to showcase on your CV! Nowadays, recruiters evaluate a candidate’s potential by his/her work and don’t put a lot of emphasis on certifications. It wouldn’t matter if you just tell them how much you know if you have nothing to show them! That’s where most people struggle and miss out.\n",

    "You might have worked on several problems before, but if you can’t make it presentable & easy-to-explain, how on earth would someone know what you are capable of? That’s where these projects will help you. Think of the time you’ll spend on these projects like your training sessions. The more time you spend practicing, the better you’ll become!\n",
